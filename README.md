The app's code is organized using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. The Model represents the app's data and business logic, the View is responsible for displaying the app's user interface, and the Controller handles user input and updates the Model and View as necessary.

- `lib/models`: Contains the app's data models and business logic
- `lib/views`: Contains the app's user interface code
- `lib/controllers`: Contains the app's controllers, which handle user input and update the Model and View as necessary
